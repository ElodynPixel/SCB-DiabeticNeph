            "\n",
            "Diabetic nephropathy affects your kidneys' ability to do their usual work of removing waste products and extra fluid from your body. The best way to prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and treating your diabetes and high blood pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over many years, the condition slowly damages your kidneys' delicate filtering system. Early treatment may prevent or slow the disease's progress and reduce the chance of complications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your kidney disease may progress to kidney failure, also called end-stage kidney disease. Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition. At this stage your treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n",

Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine. Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kidney cross section Open pop-up dialog box Close Kidney cross section Kidney cross section Blood enters your kidneys through your renal arteries. Your kidneys remove excess fluid and waste material from your blood through units called nephrons. Each nephron contains a filter (glomerulus) that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The glomeruli filter waste products and substances your body needs — such as sodium, phosphorus and potassium — which then pass through tiny tubules. The substances your body needs are reabsorbed into your bloodstream. The waste products flow through the ureters — the tubes that lead to the bladder.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Severe damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy, decreased kidney function and kidney failure.\n",

            "\n",
            "Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can cause damage to blood vessel clusters in your kidneys that filter waste from your blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure can cause further kidney damage by increasing the pressure in the delicate filtering system of the kidneys.\n",

            "\n",

with diabetes eventually develop kidney disease.', \"Diabetic nephropathy affects your kidneys' ability to do their usual work of removing waste products and extra fluid from your body.\", 'The best way to prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and treating your diabetes and high blood pressure.', \"Over many years, the condition slowly damages your kidneys' delicate filtering system.\", \"Early treatment may prevent or slow the disease's progress and reduce the chance of complications.\", 'Your kidney disease may progress to kidney failure, also called end-stage kidney disease.', 'Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition.', 'At this stage your treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant.', 'How kidneys work\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nIn the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, you may not notice any signs or symptoms.', 'In later stages, the signs and symptoms include:\\n\\nWorsening blood pressure control\\n\\nProtein in the urine\\n\\nSwelling of feet, ankles, hands or eyes\\n\\nIncreased need to urinate\\n\\nReduced need for insulin or diabetes medicine\\n\\nConfusion or difficulty concentrating\\n\\nShortness of

Open pop-up dialog box Close Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney A normal kidney has about 1 million filtering units.', 'Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a

'Kidney cross section Open pop-up dialog box Close Kidney cross section Kidney cross section Blood enters your kidneys through your renal arteries.', 'Your kidneys remove excess fluid and waste material from your blood through units called nephrons.', 'Each nephron contains a filter (glomerulus) that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.', 'The glomeruli filter waste products and substances your body needs — such as sodium, phosphorus and potassium — which then pass through tiny tubules.', 'The substances your body needs are reabsorbed into your bloodstream.', 'The waste products flow through the ureters — the tubes that lead to the bladder.', 'Your kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood.',
